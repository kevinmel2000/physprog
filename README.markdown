PHYSICAL PROGRAMMING
====================

This is a book on Physical Programming - the art of exploiting
hardware in software, and vice versa.


Author
------

I have a PhD in Engineering from the University of Cambridge in the
field of chip design. I have also been actively programming since I
started as a child with LOGO in 1989.


Motivation
----------

I began to think about writing this book in 2009, when I began
noticing an invisible divide that tends to separate the hardware and
software developers in a team. The hardware developers tend to ignore
mecurial algorithms and data structures while the software developers
do not want to think about semiconductor physics when they code.

As a result, hardware-software co-design tends to suffer.

Therefore, I started to raise awareness on this issue by giving
seminars and discussing this issue with industry
practitioners. Through these venues, I found that the problem was real
and not imaginary.

This book attempts to bridge that divide by providing clear examples
of how software should be written to exploit hardware, and how
hardware could be designed to support software.


Audience
--------

This book is targeted at an intermediate reader - someone who already
knows how to code in C/C++ and who has the necessary electronics and
microprocessor fundamentals.
